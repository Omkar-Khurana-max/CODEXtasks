*Task 1 – Data Analysis & Visualization (Titanic Dataset)*

Tools Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

Work Done:
Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, checking duplicates).
Calculated basic statistics such as mean, min, and max of selected columns.
Created the following visualizations using Matplotlib only:
Bar Chart
Scatter Plot
Heatmap

Added insights and observations based on the graphs.

*Task 2 – Linear Regression Model (House Price Prediction)*

Tools Used:
Python
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib

Work Done:

Loaded and preprocessed a house pricing dataset.
Selected relevant features (e.g., area, number of rooms, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained a Linear Regression model.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.
Visualized actual vs predicted values.

*Task 3 – Matrix Operations Tool (NumPy + Python)*

Tools Used:
Python
NumPy

Work Done:
Created a menu-driven Matrix Operations Tool that allows the user to:
Add two matrices
Subtract two matrices
Multiply two matrices
Find the transpose of a matrix
Find the determinant of a matrix

The tool includes:
Structured output formatting
Basic input validation
An interactive interface for repeated operations

Files:
matrix.py

*How to Run the Files*
Download the repository or clone it.
Open the .ipynb files in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.
